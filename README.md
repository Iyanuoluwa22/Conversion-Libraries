# Conversion-Libraries
Convert measurements such as length, temperature, area, etc. using the convertTo library I created. 

Each library takes in two strings and the number you want to convert. The first string should be what you're converting from and the 2nd string should be what you're converting to. 
The strings should be typed using abbreviations. 
Ex. convertTo::convertLength("mm","in",51);
